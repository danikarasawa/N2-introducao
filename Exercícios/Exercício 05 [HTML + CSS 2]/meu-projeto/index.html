    <div>
        <p><q>Go Beyond! Plus Ultra!</q><br /> ― U.A.'s official motto</p>
        <p><b>U.A. High School</b> (雄ゆう英えい高こう校こう Yūei Kōkō?) is an academy where students learn and train to become
            heroes.
            It is one of the main settings in which the story takes place.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>U.A. is the #1 ranked high school for heroics and is considered as the top Hero Academy in Japan. Students
            are
            separated based on their abilities into specific Departments and Classes - A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and
            K.
            At the entrance, there is a security wall nicknamed the "U.A. Barrier" that automatically closes if a
            person
            does not have a Student ID Card or Special Entry Permission ID. Many precautions have been made to keep
            members
            of the press and villains out.</p>
