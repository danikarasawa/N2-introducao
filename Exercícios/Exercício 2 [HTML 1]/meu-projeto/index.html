    <h3>History</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>U.A. is the #1 ranked high school for heroics and is considered as the top Hero Academy in Japan. Students are
        separated based on their abilities into specific Departments and Classes - A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and K.
        At the entrance, there is a security wall nicknamed the <i>"U.A. Barrier"</i> that automatically closes if a person
        does not have a <u>Student ID Card</u> or <u>Special Entry Permission ID</u>. Many precautions have been made to keep members
        of the press and villains out.</p>
